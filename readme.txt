                      gbhd - Play Game Boy games in HD
=============================================================================


================================= Building ==================================

Currently this project is set up to build with Visual Studio 2010. The
solution file can be found in build/vs2010/gbhd.sln.

================================= Running ===================================

Once built, gbhd expects to be run from the command line with a Game Boy
ROM file as an argument, e.g.:

gbhd tetris.gb

The controls for the game are currently hard-wired:

A, B        = A, B
I, J, K, L  =   Up, Left, Down, Right
S           = Start
T           = Select
